There is a large setup violation of -4.223 ns between SP_OV_i/P_COUNTER_wrapper_0/U0/P_COUNTER_i/EX_TRIG_CTL_0/U0/lwin_reg/C (clocked by clk_out1_SP_OV_clk_wiz_1_1_1) and SP_OV_i/P_COUNTER_wrapper_0/U0/P_COUNTER_i/c_counter_binary_2/U0/i_synth/i_baseip.i_xbip_counter/i_dsp48.i_dsp/i_vx7.i_dsp48e_wrap/i_primitive/CEP (clocked by clk_out2_SP_OV_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock Counter_Overlay_i/clk_wiz_1_clk_out1 is created on an inappropriate pin Counter_Overlay_i/c_clk/inst/clkout1_buf/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock Counter_Overlay_i/clk_wiz_1_clk_out1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_Counter_Overlay_clk_wiz_1_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and Counter_Overlay_i/clk_wiz_1_clk_out1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks Counter_Overlay_i/clk_wiz_1_clk_out1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_Counter_Overlay_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_Counter_Overlay_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and Counter_Overlay_i/clk_wiz_1_clk_out1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks Counter_Overlay_i/clk_wiz_1_clk_out1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_Counter_Overlay_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_Counter_Overlay_clk_wiz_0_0]

There is a large setup violation of -5.198 ns between Counter_Overlay_i/CH_0/U0/COUNTER_i/axi_gpio_util/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and Counter_Overlay_i/CH_0/U0/COUNTER_i/DIG_TIMER_0/U0/count_reg[0]/R (clocked by clk_out1_Counter_Overlay_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.

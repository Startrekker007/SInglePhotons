PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Counter_Overlay_i/CH_0/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Counter_Overlay_i/CH_0/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/c_counter_binary_0_i_1/O, cell Counter_Overlay_i/CH_0/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/c_counter_binary_0_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Counter_Overlay_i/CH_1/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Counter_Overlay_i/CH_1/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/c_counter_binary_0_i_1/O, cell Counter_Overlay_i/CH_1/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/c_counter_binary_0_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Counter_Overlay_i/CH_2/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Counter_Overlay_i/CH_2/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/c_counter_binary_0_i_1/O, cell Counter_Overlay_i/CH_2/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/c_counter_binary_0_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Counter_Overlay_i/CH_3/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Counter_Overlay_i/CH_3/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/c_counter_binary_0_i_1/O, cell Counter_Overlay_i/CH_3/U0/COUNTER_i/CTR_CTL_0/U0/c_counter_binary_0_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

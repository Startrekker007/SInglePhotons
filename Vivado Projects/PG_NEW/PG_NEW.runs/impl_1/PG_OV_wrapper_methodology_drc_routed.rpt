2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock PG_OV_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock PG_OV_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_PG_OV_clk_wiz_2_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#3 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock PG_OV_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#4 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock PG_OV_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_PG_OV_clk_wiz_2_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock PG_OV_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin PG_OV_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock PG_OV_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin PG_OV_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

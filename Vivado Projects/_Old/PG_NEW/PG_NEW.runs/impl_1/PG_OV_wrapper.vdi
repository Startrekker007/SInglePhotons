CRITICAL WARNING: [Netlist 29-160] Cannot set property 'BOARD_PIN', because the property does not exist for objects of type 'pin'. [d:/SInglePhotons/Vivado Projects/PG_NEW/PG_NEW.srcs/sources_1/bd/PG_OV/ip/PG_OV_clk_wiz_0_0/PG_OV_clk_wiz_0_0_board.xdc:3]
Resolution: Modify the set_property command to apply the property on the correct object type. Since the property is being applied as a scoped constraint, ensure the proper connectivity of the object port objects can be translated into pin objects. This could be due to the insertion of IO Buffers between the top level terminal and cell pin. If the goal is to apply constraints that will migrate to top level ports it is required that IO Buffers manually be instanced.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net PG_OV_i/util_vector_logic_0/Res[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PG_OV_i/util_vector_logic_0/Res[0]_INST_0/O, cell PG_OV_i/util_vector_logic_0/Res[0]_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

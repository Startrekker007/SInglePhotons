2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_0_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_1_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_1_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_1_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_1_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1959#1 Advisory
connects_SERDES_RST_driver_not_FF  
HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master: The RST pin should only be driven by a Flip-flop.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1959#2 Advisory
connects_SERDES_RST_driver_not_FF  
HS_SAMPLER_OVERLAY_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_slave: The RST pin should only be driven by a Flip-flop.
Related violations: <none>

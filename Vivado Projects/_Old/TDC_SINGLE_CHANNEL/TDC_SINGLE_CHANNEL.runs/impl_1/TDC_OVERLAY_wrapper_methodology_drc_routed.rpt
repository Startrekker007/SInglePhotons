TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_TDC_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_TDC_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_TDC_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_TDC_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_TDC_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_TDC_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.676 ns between TDC_OVERLAY_i/TCH_TDC_OV_wrapper_0/U0/TCH_TDC_OV_i/S_EDGE_DET_0/U0/dn_reg/C (clocked by clk_out1_TDC_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_0_0) and TDC_OVERLAY_i/TCH_TDC_OV_wrapper_0/U0/TCH_TDC_OV_i/S_EDGE_DET_0/U0/ARMED_reg/CE (clocked by clk_out1_TDC_OVERLAY_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

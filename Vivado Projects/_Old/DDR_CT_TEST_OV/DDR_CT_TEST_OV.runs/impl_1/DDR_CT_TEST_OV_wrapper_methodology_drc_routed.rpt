TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock DDR_CT_TEST_OV_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_DDR_CT_TEST_OV_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_DDR_CT_TEST_OV_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks

2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/ref_clk/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/ref_clk/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/ref_clk/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/Temptest_0/OUTP_INST_0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/IDELAY_CTRL_WRAPPER_0/U0/IDELAYCTRL_inst/RST, DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/IDELAY_CTRL_WRAPPER_0/U0/IDELAYCTRL_inst_REPLICATED_0/RST, DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/IDELAY_CTRL_WRAPPER_0/U0/IDELAYCTRL_inst_REPLICATED_0_1/RST, DSCH_AXI_PERIPH_i/IDELAY_CTRL_WRAPPER_0/U0/IDELAYCTRL_inst_REPLICATED_0_2/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

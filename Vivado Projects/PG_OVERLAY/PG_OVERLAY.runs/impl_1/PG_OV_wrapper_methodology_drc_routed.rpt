TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_PG_OV_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_PG_OV_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_PG_OV_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_PG_OV_clk_wiz_0_0]

There is a large setup violation of -6.764 ns between PG_OV_i/PG_AXI_CH_wrapper_0/U0/PG_AXI_CH_i/axi_util_0/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and PG_OV_i/PG_AXI_CH_wrapper_0/U0/PG_AXI_CH_i/GEN_CORE_0/U0/aDC_THRESHOLD_reg[2]/CE (clocked by clk_out1_PG_OV_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

There is a large setup violation of -2.647 ns between ST_TEST_i/DUTIL/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and ST_TEST_i/ST_TEST_selectio_wiz_1/U0/inst/pins[0].idelaye2_bus/LD (clocked by clk_out4_ST_TEST_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

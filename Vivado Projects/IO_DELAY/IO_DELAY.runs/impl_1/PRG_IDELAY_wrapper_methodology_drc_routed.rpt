2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_PRG_IDELAY_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_PRG_IDELAY_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_PRG_IDELAY_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_PRG_IDELAY_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.531 ns between PRG_IDELAY_i/del0/U0/gpio_core_1/Not_Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and PRG_IDELAY_i/IDELAY_BOI_0/U0/IDELAYE2_inst/CNTVALUEIN[1] (clocked by clk_out1_PRG_IDELAY_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.531 ns between PRG_IDELAY_i/del1/U0/gpio_core_1/Not_Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and PRG_IDELAY_i/IDELAY_BOI_1/U0/IDELAYE2_inst/CNTVALUEIN[1] (clocked by clk_out1_PRG_IDELAY_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

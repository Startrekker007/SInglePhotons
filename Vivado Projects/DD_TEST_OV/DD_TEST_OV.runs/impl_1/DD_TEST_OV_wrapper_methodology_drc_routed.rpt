TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_DD_TEST_OV_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_DD_TEST_OV_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_DD_TEST_OV_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_DD_TEST_OV_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_DD_TEST_OV_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_DD_TEST_OV_clk_wiz_0_0]

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell DD_TEST_OV_i/DD_AXI_PERIPH_wrapper_0/U0/DD_AXI_PERIPH_i/IODELAY_BLK_wrapper_0/U0/IODELAY_BLK_i/DD_CTRL_0/U0/all_taps[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) DD_TEST_OV_i/DD_AXI_PERIPH_wrapper_0/U0/DD_AXI_PERIPH_i/IDELAY_CTRL_WRAPPER_0/U0/IDELAYCTRL_inst/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

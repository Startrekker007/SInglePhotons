2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock TEST_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out2_TEST_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_TEST_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out2_TEST_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_TEST_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock TEST_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin TEST_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell TEST_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/RD.ar_channel_0/ar_cmd_fsm_0/FSM_sequential_state[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) TEST_i/SDDR_TT_M_wrapper_0/U0/SDDR_TT_M_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/RST, TEST_i/SDDR_TT_M_wrapper_0/U0/SDDR_TT_M_i/selectio_wiz_1/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/RST, TEST_i/SDDR_TT_M_wrapper_0/U0/SDDR_TT_M_i/selectio_wiz_2/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/RST, TEST_i/SDDR_TT_M_wrapper_0/U0/SDDR_TT_M_i/selectio_wiz_3/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/RST, TEST_i/SDDR_TT_M_wrapper_0/U0/SDDR_TT_M_i/selectio_wiz_4/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

TIMING-16#496 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.408 ns between TEST_i/O_UTIL/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.gpio2_Data_Out_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and TEST_i/SDDR_TT_M_wrapper_0/U0/SDDR_TT_M_i/SDDR_TT_0/U0/uctr_reg[4]/R (clocked by clk_out2_TEST_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
